# Test Bot
*The most interesting bot in the world.*

This repo will contain any code I feel like testing for my Discord bots.

## Getting Started
### Installing requirements
From Python3: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\
From Bash: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Managing your token
This bot pulls the bot token from a file called `token.txt`\
Note: This is *not* a secure way to store your token! Do not do this in a production environment!
